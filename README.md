This repository contains codes and data utilized in a research; "Performance Evaluation of LoRa Technology for Rural Connectivity: An Experimental Analysis in Nepal".
The research was conducted in Dhulikhel Nepal with two different setups, one was to establish low-cost LoRaWAN integrating IoT along with utilizing the Time Division Multiple Access technique and another was a long-distance point-to-point connection to evaluate LoRa communication performance by altering the physical layer parameters. Metrics like SNR, RSSI, and Packetloss were evaluated for different combinations of Spreading Factor, Bandwidth, and Coding Rate. 
The spreadsheet containing data and the calculations can be found inside "Data" in this repo.
The codes for both setups can be found inside "Codes and Assets". 
Boards were programmed using the Arduino IDE platform and data analysis was done in MATLAB.
